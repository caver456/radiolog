Nevada County Sheriff's Search and Rescue (ncssar-nc.org) has been using this radio log tool on every callout since early 2015.

This open-source project is mainly intended for use by other Search and Rescue teams.  While it's not currently (Nov. 10 2016) in an easily installable state, one of our biggest issues will be to make a clean installer.  Until then, please contact the author if your team is interested in using this software.

See the latest installation procedure [here](INSTALL.md).

See guidelines for contributing to this project [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
